## **Cross-Site Script Inclusion**:
- Cross Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) vulnerability allows sensitive data leakage across-origin or cross-domain boundaries. Sensitive data could include authentication-related data (login states, cookies, auth tokens, session IDs, etc.) or userâ€™s personal or sensitive personal data (email addresses, phone numbers, credit card details, social security numbers, etc.)
- [More](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/11-Client-side_Testing/13-Testing_for_Cross_Site_Script_Inclusion).
## **Types Of XSSI**:
1. Regular XSSI - Static Javascript
- This is similar to looking for the hardcoded data in a javascript file.
- Since the javascript file is static, an attacker can try to embed it a page in order to extract information. 
2. Authenticated Access to Static Javascript.
3. Dynamic Javascript.
4. Non-Script Attack.

## **Tool**:
1. Detect Dynamic JavaScript Files(burp extension) 
[Here](https://github.com/luh2/DetectDynamicJS).
- Use Detect DynamicJS Burp Plugin
- This works on the same principle. Passively scanning all JS files and than scanning those files without authentication identifier like cookies. 
- If issue is found, it will be seen under Target Tab as Informational severity finding.
